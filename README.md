In approaching the design of my 3D scene, I focused on creating a clear vision of the final product while remaining flexible during the design process. I started by considering the overall aesthetic and functionality of the scene, ensuring that each object was represented in a way that was both visually appealing and structurally sound. My design skills were further developed by learning how to balance the lighting, textures, and materials to create a realistic and cohesive scene. I followed a process that involved breaking down the project into manageable tasksâ€”first, modeling the objects, then texturing them, and finally refining the lighting to achieve the desired effect. Throughout the project, I learned how to adapt my design approach based on feedback and experimentation, which helped me understand how to use the design process to solve complex problems and achieve specific visual outcomes. These tactics can be applied in future projects where attention to detail, iteration, and adaptation are key to success.

When developing the program for this 3D scene, I employed strategies such as modular coding and incremental development. I started with basic shapes and gradually added more complexity, ensuring that each step was functioning correctly before moving on to the next. Iteration was a critical factor in my development process. I constantly tested different lighting setups and textures, making small adjustments to refine the overall look of the scene. As I progressed through the milestones, my approach to developing the scene evolved from focusing on basic object creation to refining lighting and texturing, which enhanced the visual quality and realism. This iterative process taught me how important it is to continuously evaluate and adjust your work, especially in complex projects like 3D graphics.

Computer science has played a significant role in helping me reach my educational and professional goals by providing me with the tools and techniques necessary to solve creative and technical problems. In particular, computational graphics and visualizations have equipped me with valuable knowledge and skills that are applicable in both my future education and professional career. The ability to create and manipulate 3D objects, apply realistic textures, and manage lighting is a skill set that can be used in fields such as game development, simulations, and user interface design. I can apply these skills in future educational projects by deepening my understanding of computer graphics, and in my professional career, these skills will allow me to work in industries that require strong visualization and problem-solving abilities, such as software development or digital media.
